# Quantum Support Vector Regression for Stock Price Forecasting

This project applies **Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR)** using Qiskit to forecast stock prices. It explores the potential of quantum-enhanced regression models for financial predictions.

## Key Features
- **Quantum Kernel Regression:** Uses `ZZFeatureMap` for feature encoding.
- **Stock Price Data:** Fetches historical data from **Yahoo Finance**.
- **Feature Engineering:** Computes **Simple Moving Averages (SMA-5, SMA-10)**.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Compares predicted vs. actual stock prices.
